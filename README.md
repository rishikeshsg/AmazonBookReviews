Features that did not work.

Task 2: Rating Prediction

I implemented a latent factor model for predicting the rating of the books. We are treating user and item features independently. This is most probably because we did not have enough data for user-item feature modelling, that is, a user had rated only a few books. So we were not able to fit a good model to this data.
